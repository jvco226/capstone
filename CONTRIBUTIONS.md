# Project Contributions

## Timothy Clapper
For my contribution to the project, I focused primarily on the backend environment setup and the database system. I created and configured several core files, including the .gitignore, .env.example, docker-compose.yml, package.json, db.js, and verify-db.js. These files handled essential functions such as environment variable management, installing and organizing project dependencies, creating a consistent containerized Postgres database instance, and establishing the database connection layer used throughout the application. In addition to those core files, I also assisted with the sql/init.sql file, where I helped refine the database schema to match the needs of the game logic, and I supported work on the server.js. Overall, my work centered on building the backend foundation of the project and ensuring that the server and database operated reliably together.

For the first two milestones, my role mostly consisted of implementation of other group members aspects. While I created the basic outline for server logic, I was responsible for combining files provided by the other group members to ensure that the individual aspects were compatible with one another. This included bug-fixing, editing aspects of index.html and server.js files mostly, and ensuring that everything was done and in a mostly bug-free state prior to the submission deadline. Because of this, I then took on the role of implementing the public lobby user story mostly single-handedly, as the skeleton was already set up due to the creation of private lobbies. Essentially, I added onto the index.html file to create the public lobby button and ensure it responded correctly, as well as editing the server.js file to differentiate between private and public lobbies so that you can never join a private lobby when hitting the public lobby button.

For my contribution to the project, I focused on implementing the complete game functionality and enhancing the user experience. I developed the player name selection system, which allows players to join a room first and then choose their name in the lobby, creating a more intuitive flow with pending and ready player states. I implemented the full trivia game system, including a comprehensive question database with 50 questions across multiple categories (5 randomly selected per game), answer submission handling, and a scoring system that rewards both correctness and speed (up to 1000 points per question). I created the game state management system that handles transitions between lobby, playing, and results states, ensuring players cannot join rooms during active games. I implemented host controls, where only the room creator can start games, with automatic host reassignment if the original host leaves. I built the complete game UI including the question display page with interactive answer buttons, real-time score updates, answer feedback, and a results page with a leaderboard showing ranked players. I integrated WebSocket events for real-time game synchronization, including gameStarted, nextQuestion, answerSubmitted, and gameEnded events. Additionally, I added validation for minimum players and implemented the ability to test with a single player for development purposes. My work transformed the project from a basic lobby system into a fully functional multiplayer trivia game with complete game flow, scoring, and results tracking.
